## About
This repository is designed to provide practical implementations and detailed explanations for various data structures. Each data structure includes:
- **Core operations** such as insertion, deletion, traversal, search, and sorting (where applicable).
- **Code implementation** in Python with a focus on readability and clarity.
- **Example programs** to demonstrate usage and test functionality.

This repository is suitable for:
- Learning data structures and their operations.
- Practicing coding for technical interviews.
- Enhancing your understanding of fundamental algorithms.

## Implemented Data Structures
The repository covers the following data structures, each with all essential operations implemented:

1. **Array**  
   - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Traversal, Search, Sorting.  

2. **Stack**  
   - Implementations: Using arrays and linked lists.  
   - Operations: Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty, Size.  

3. **Queue**  
   - Implementations: Regular Queue, Circular Queue, and Priority Queue.  
   - Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek, IsEmpty, Size.  

4. **Linked List**  
   - Types: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular Linked List.  
   - Operations: Insertion (at head, tail, specific position), Deletion, Search, Traversal.  

5. **Tree**  
   - Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree.  
   - Operations: Insertion, Deletion, Search, Traversals (In-Order, Pre-Order, Post-Order, Level-Order).  

6. **Graph**  
   - Representations: Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List.  
   - Operations: Add Vertex, Add Edge, Remove Vertex, Remove Edge, Search (DFS, BFS).
